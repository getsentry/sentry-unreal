Sentry SDK for Unreal Engine
===========

This project is an SDK for Unreal Engine that wraps different Sentry's SDKs for desktop, mobile, and console. Also, it [has stable support for the Unreal Engine Crash Reporter](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreport/).

## Downloads

The SDK can be downloaded from the [Releases] page, which also lists the
changelog of every version, or from the [UE Marketplace] page via Epic Games launcher.

[Releases]: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/releases
[UE Marketplace]: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/sentry-01

If manual download from the [Releases] page is a preferred way for plugin integration using the package with the `github` suffix in its name is recommended.

## Supported Platforms and Unreal Engine Versions

The SDK currently supports and is tested on the following platforms:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS
- Xbox Series X|S

The SDK compiles with three latest engine versions.

## Known Limitations

- On all platforms, captured crashes are uploaded to Sentry only after relaunching the crashed app since the in-process handler cannot do this within the same session. The only exceptions are Windows (if using the GitHub package) and Linux for which the out-of-process `crashpad` handler is used and crashes are uploaded immediately.
- Xbox Series X|S is configured with `breakpad` (in-process crash handling) instead of `crashpad` due to the nature of Xbox packaged builds.
- Automatic crash handling and crash dump writing on Xbox Series X|S will require Engine code modifications that replicate Structured Exception Handling (SEH) changes made to Windows (until Epic upstreams the proposal).
- To automatically capture crashes in Windows game builds that were made using engine versions prior to UE 5.2, the [Crash Reporter has to be configured](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreport/) first.
- Using Unreal Game Sync (UGS) binaries requires tagging of files to ensure the `crashpad_handler.exe` is present. For inclusion in BuildGraph, you'd want something like this:

```xml
<Tag Files="#EditorBinaries$(EditorPlatform)" 
     Filter="*.target" 
     With="#TargetReceipts" />
<Tag Files="#RuntimeDependencies"
     Filter="sentry.dll;crashpad_handler.exe"
     With="#BinariesToArchive$(EditorPlatform)" />
<TagReceipt Files="#TargetReceipts"
            RuntimeDependencies="true"
            With="#RuntimeDependencies" />
 ```

- In UE 5.2 or newer game log attached to crashes captured with `sentry-native` integration instead of [Crash Reporter](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreport/) could be truncated. This is caused by current `crashpad` behavior which sends crashes to Sentry right away while UE is still about to write some bits of information to the log file.
- Only crash events captured on Android contain the full callstack. Events that were captured manually won't have the native C++ part there.
- On Windows/Linux if crash event was captured during the garbage collection the `BeforeSendHandler` will not be invoked.
- It may be required to upgrade the C++ standard library (`libstdc++`) on older Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04) to ensure crashpad handler proper functionality within the deployment environment. This can be achieved with something like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get install -y libstdc++6
```

- Plugin supports Linux arm64 platform for UE 5.0 and newer.

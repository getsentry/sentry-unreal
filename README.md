Sentry SDK for Unreal Engine
===========

This project is an SDK for Unreal Engine that wraps different Sentry's SDKs for both desktop and mobile. Also, it [has a stable support for the Unreal Engine crash reporter](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreport/).

## Downloads

The SDK can be downloaded from the [Releases] page, which also lists the
changelog of every version, or from the [UE Marketplace] page via Epic Games launcher.

[releases]: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/releases
[UE Marketplace]: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/sentry-01

If manual download from the [Releases] page is a preferred way for plugin integration using the package with the `github` suffix in its name is recommended.

## Supported Platforms and Unreal Engine version

The SDK currently supports and is tested on the following platforms:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux 
- Android
- iOS

The SDK compiles with three latest engine versions.

## Known Limitations

- On all platforms captured crashes are uploaded to Sentry only after relaunching the crashed app since the in-process handler cannot do this within the same session. The only exceptions are Windows (if using the GitHub package) and Linux for which the out-of-process crashpad handler is used and crashes are uploaded immediately.

- To automatically capture crashes in Windows game builds that were made using engine versions prior to UE 5.2, the [Crash Reporter has to be configured](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreport/) first.
  
- Using UGS binaries requires tagging of files to ensure the crashpad_handler.exe is present. For inclusion in build graph, you'd want something like this: 
```
<Tag Files="#EditorBinaries$(EditorPlatform)" Filter="*.target" With="#TargetReceipts"/>
<TagReceipt Files="#TargetReceipts" RuntimeDependencies="true" With="#RuntimeDependencies"/>
<Tag Files="#RuntimeDependencies" Filter="sentry.dll;crashpad_handler.exe" With="#BinariesToArchive$(EditorPlatform)"/>
 ```

- In UE 5.2 or newer game log attached to crashes captured with `sentry-native` integration instead of [crash reporter](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreport/) could be truncated. This is caused by current `crashpad` behavior which sends crashes to Sentry right away while UE is still about to write some bits of information to the log file.

- Only crash events captured on Android contain the full callstack. Events that were captured manually won't have the native C++ part there.

- On Windows/Linux if crash event was captured during the garbage collection the `BeforeSendHandler` will not be invoked.

- It may be required to upgrade the C++ standard library (`libstdc++`) on older Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04) to ensure crashpad handler proper functionality within the deployment environment. This can be achieved with something like this:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get install -y libstdc++6
```
